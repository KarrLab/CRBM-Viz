      <biosimulations-q-a
        heading="Are there any limitations to the COMBINE/OMEX archives and SED-ML files that runBioSimulations can execute?"
      >
        <p>
          runBioSimulations is designed to be able to execute any COMBINE/OMEX
          archive and the SED-ML files they contain. In practice,
          runBioSimulations cannot execute every possible COMBINE/OMEX archive
          and SED-ML file for three main reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, currently runBioSimulations focuses on the latest version of
          SED-ML (L1V3) and has limited ability to execute simulation
          experiments encoded using older versions of SED-ML. Going forward,
          runBioSimulations will support new versions of SED-ML through new
          versions of simulation tools submitted to BioSimulators that support
          these new versions of SED-ML. Because BioSimulators stores old
          versions of simulation tools, runBioSimulations will also maintain the
          ability to execute simulations that involve the current version of
          SED-ML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, runBioSimulations can only execute SED-ML files that involve
          model formats, modeling frameworks, and simulation algorithms that are
          supported by at least one of the standardized simulation tools in the
          BioSimulators registry. Presently, the standardized simulation tools
          support multiple formats, multiple frameworks, and over 40 algorithms.
          Going forward, we aim to expand this by working with the community to
          develop standardized interfaces to additional simulation tools and
          submitting them to BioSimulators.
        </p>

        <p class="no-bottom-margin">
          Third, runBioSimulations has limited ability to execute SED-ML
          documents that deviate from the specifications of the COMBINE/OMEX
          archive and SED-ML formats. In practice, this is the most significant
          limitation because some simulation tools produce SED-ML files which
          deviate from the specifications of SED-ML and because most of the
          existing SED-ML files at SED-ML.org and in model repositories such as
          BioModels deviate from the specifications of SED-ML. Below is a list
          of known issues which prevent runBioSimulations from executing many
          SED-ML files.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Broken model references</b>: The model sources in SED-ML files in
            some repositories such as BioModels are different from the actual
            locations of the model files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Missing namespace definitions</b>: Most simulation tools do not
            define URIs for the namespace prefixes used in XPath targets for
            model variables. Most existing SED-ML files at SED-ML.org and in
            model repositories also lack definitions of these namespace
            prefixes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Missing attributes</b>: Some simulation tools produce SED-ML
            files that are missing required attributes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Invalid attribute values</b>: Some simulation tools produce
            SED-ML files that have invalid values of some attributes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Non-unique identifiers</b>: Some simulation tools produce SED-ML
            files that have multiple elements with the same identifier. In such
            cases, references to these elements cannot be resolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Broken references</b>: Some simulation tools produce SED-ML files
            that have broken references (e.g., no instance of
            <code>sed:model</code> has an <code>id</code> attribute equal to the
            value of the <code>modelReference</code> attribute of a
            <code>sed:task</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Invalid XPaths to model variables</b>: Some simulation tools
            produce SED-ML files that do not have correct XPaths to variables in
            models. Most frequently, this is because some simulation tools
            confuse the ids and names of model elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Incorrect KiSAO ids for algorithms</b>: Some simulation tools
            produce SED-ML files that indicate different algorithms than what
            the simulation tool actually used to execute the simulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Inconsistent plot axes</b>: Some simulation tools produces SED-ML
            files where curves in the same plot have mixed (linear and log) x,
            y, and/or z axes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We are working with the SED-ML community to clarify the specifications
          of SED-ML and resolve these inconsistencies. To drive consistency, we
          also developed the BioSimulators test suite
          <a
            href="https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_test_suite"
            target="_blank"
            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
          ></a>
          for verifying whether simulation tools execute COMBINE/OMEX archives
          and SED-ML files consistently with the specifications of these
          formats. In addition, we developed BioSimulators utils
          <a
            href="https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_utils"
            target="_blank"
            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a
          >, a Python package which provides methods for more deeply validating
          COMBINE/OMEX archives and SED-ML files.
        </p>
      </biosimulations-q-a>

      <biosimulations-q-a
        heading="Which other tools can I use to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives? Are there any limitations executing archives with other tools?"
      >
        <p>
          runBioSimulations is designed to be compatible with the COMBINE/OMEX
          archive and SED-ML formats. In principle, this means that other tools
          such as COPASI
          <a href="http://copasi.org/" target="_blank"
            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
          ></a>
          and VCell
          <a href="https://vcell.org/" target="_blank"
            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
          ></a>
          that support these same formats should be able to execute the same
          simulations that can be executed with runBioSimulations. In practice,
          there are two main factors which limit the ability of such tools to
          execute COMBINE/OMEX archives and SED-ML files.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, each tool can only execute simulations involving a limited
          number of model formats, modeling frameworks, and simulation
          algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, some simulation tools only support a subset of SED-ML. For
          example, some tools do not support model resolution via URI fragments,
          some do not support model changes, some do not support repeated tasks,
          and some do not support 3D plots. Going forward, we hope to use
          BioSimulators to keep finer-grained track of the capabilities of each
          tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          Third, some of the inconsistencies in the implementation of COMBINE
          and SED-ML described above prevent some simulation tools from
          consistently executing some COMBINE/OMEX archives and SED-ML files. In
          particular, some tools cannot execute COMBINE/OMEX archives that
          organize files into subdirectories.

      >
        <p>There are several reasons why simulations can fail including:</p>

        <ul class="vertically-spaced">
          <li>
            The simulator that you selected is not capable of executing your
            archive. Because each simulator supports different modeling
            frameworks, simulation algorithms, and model formats, any given
            archive is only compatible with a subset of simulation tools.
            BioSimulators describes the modeling frameworks, simulation
            algorithms, and model formats that each simulation tool supports. We
            recommend using BioSimulators to determine which simulation tools
            are compatible with your archive. Note, that BioSimulators does not
            capture every detail about the capabilities of each simulation tool,
            in part, because BioSimulators relies on the community to curate
            simulation tools. For example, BioSimulators has limited information
            about which SBML elements (e.g., delays, events) most simulation
            tools support. As a result, to determine which tools are compatible
            with your archive, it may also be necessary to read the
            documentation for several potentially compatible simulation tools.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive or one of the models or simulations inside your archive
            is invalid. In particular, because many modeling tools are just
            beginning to support SED-ML, some tools do not yet produce valid
            SED-ML files. We recommend creating simulations with tools that
            faithfully support SED-ML such as tellurium and VCell.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive describes one or more simulations that can't be solved.
            For example, many algorithms may not be able to solve a stiff model
            up to the desired tolerance in the specified number of execution
            steps. In this case, we recommend using an alernative algorithm such
            as CVODE or LSODA for continuous kinetic models or restructuring
            your model.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive generates very large outputs. runBioSimulations is
            architected to support arbitrarily large models and simulations.
            However, because runBioSimulations hasn't yet been hardened from
            years of use, users may still discover bugs in runBioSimulations. In
            this case, please help us improve runBioSimulations by using GitHub

          runBioSimulations provides two methods of visualizing simulation
          results. First, runBioSimulations provides a simple form for
          configuring two-dimensional line plots and scatter plots of pairs of
          data sets. These two-dimensional plots support linear and logarithmic
          axes.

        <p>
          In addition, users can use data visualizations in Vega format
          <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/" target="_blank"
            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
          ></a>
          by uploading a Vega file and using a simple form to map the inputs of
          the visualization (Vega data sets) to the outputs of the COMBINE
          archive (SED-ML reports). Vega is a flexible format that can capture a
          wide range of high quality, interactive visualizations. By modularly
          defining graphical marks and how they should be painted with data,
          Vega also makes diagrams reusable so the same diagram can be
          re-painted with results of multiple simulation conditions.

          BioSimulators encourages developers to use systems such as CircleCI
          and GitHub actions to automate the release of new versions.
          BioSimulators provides template actions for developers. In addition,
          BioSimulators has developed a automated testing system to ensure that

      >
        runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of containerized
        simulation software tools. These containers make it easy to execute
        simulations by all providing the same command-line interface. The
        containers are easy to install and run on your own machine. The
        containers can be used on top of any operating system. Please see

        for more information about how to install and run these containers.

      >
        No. runBioSimulations does not have user accounts. No account or
        registration is necessary to use runBioSimulations. Optionally, you can
        provide your email to receive notification of the completion of your
        simulations.

        heading="How does runBioSimulations store a list of my simulations without user accounts?"
      >
        The list of your simulations is stored in your local browser. Unless you
        provided your email address, the runRioSimulations server does not know
        which simulations you submitted. As a result, if your clear your
        browser's cache, you will lose the list of your simulations, and it will
        not be possible to recover this list.
