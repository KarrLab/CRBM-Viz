        heading="Why did my simulation fail? How can I get my simulation to succeed?"
      >
        <p>There are several reasons why simulations can fail including:</p>

        <ul class="vertically-spaced">
          <li>
            The simulator that you selected is not capable of executing your
            archive. Because each simulator supports different modeling
            frameworks, simulation algorithms, and model formats, any given
            archive is only compatible with a subset of simulation tools.
            BioSimulators describes the modeling frameworks, simulation
            algorithms, and model formats that each simulation tool supports. We
            recommend using BioSimulators to determine which simulation tools
            are compatible with your archive. Note, that BioSimulators does not
            capture every detail about the capabilities of each simulation tool,
            in part, because BioSimulators relies on the community to curate
            simulation tools. For example, BioSimulators has limited information
            about which SBML elements (e.g., delays, events) most simulation
            tools support. As a result, to determine which tools are compatible
            with your archive, it may also be necessary to read the
            documentation for several potentially compatible simulation tools.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive or one of the models or simulations inside your archive
            is invalid. In particular, because many modeling tools are just
            beginning to support SED-ML, some tools do not yet produce valid
            SED-ML files. We recommend creating simulations with tools that
            faithfully support SED-ML such as tellurium and VCell.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive describes one or more simulations that can't be solved.
            For example, many algorithms may not be able to solve a stiff model
            up to the desired tolerance in the specified number of execution
            steps. In this case, we recommend using an alernative algorithm such
            as CVODE or LSODA for continuous kinetic models or restructuring
            your model.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your archive generates very large outputs. runBioSimulations is
            architected to support arbitrarily large models and simulations.
            However, because runBioSimulations hasn't yet been hardened from
            years of use, users may still discover bugs in runBioSimulations. In
            this case, please help us improve runBioSimulations by using GitHub

We recommend that investigators who wish to execute simulations involving confidential data use the simulation tools provided by BioSimulators <a href="https://biosimulators.org" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> to execute simulations using their own hardware or contact the BioSimulators Team <a href="emailUrl"><biosimulations-icon icon="email"></biosimulations-icon></a> to discuss other options.

      <biosimulations-q-a
        heading="What types of plots can runBioSimulations render?"
      >
        <p>runBioSimulations provides two methods of visualizing simulation results. First, runBioSimulations provides a simple form for configuring two-dimensional line plots and scatter plots of pairs of data sets. These two-dimensional plots support linear and logarithmic axes.</p>

        <p>In addition, users can use data visualizations in Vega format <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a> by uploading a Vega file and using a simple form to map the inputs of the visualization (Vega data sets) to the outputs of the COMBINE archive (SED-ML reports). Vega is a flexible format that can capture a wide range of high quality, interactive visualizations. By modularly defining graphical marks and how they should be painted with data, Vega also makes diagrams reusable so the same diagram can be re-painted with results of multiple simulation conditions. Recommendations for using Vega to visualize simulation results are available here <a href="https://biosimulators.org/standards/data-viz"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>. Example visualizations for simulation predictions are available here <a href="https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_test_suite/tree/dev/examples" target="_blank"><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a>.</p>

        runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of containerized
        simulation software tools. These containers make it easy to execute
        simulations by all providing the same command-line interface. The
        containers are easy to install and run on your own machine. The
        containers can be used on top of any operating system. Please see
        <a href="https://biosimulators.org" target="_blank"
          >https://biosimulators.org</a

        for more information about how to install and run these containers.

        No. runBioSimulations does not have user accounts. No account or

      >
        The list of your simulations is stored in your local browser. Unless you
        provided your email address, the runRioSimulations server does not know
        which simulations you submitted. As a result, if your clear your
        browser's cache, you will lose the list of your simulations, and it will
        not be possible to recover this list.
