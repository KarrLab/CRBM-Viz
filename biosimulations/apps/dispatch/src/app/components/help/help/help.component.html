      <p>
        runBioSimulations requires modeling projects (one or more simulations typically in SED-ML format of
        one or more models) to be described by an OMEX file and packaged into a
        COMBINE archive. Several examples COMBINE/OMEX archives are available here <a href="https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_test_suite/tree/dev/examples/" target="_blank"
          ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>COMBINE/OMEX files which describe modeling
        projects can be obtained from model repositories such as BioModels
        <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/" target="_blank"
          ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon></a
        >. However, most of the COMBINE/OMEX files currently available from BioModels are invalid. We are working with the BioModels Team to correct these files.
      </p>

      <p class="no-bottom-margin">COMBINE/OMEX archives can be created with several simulation tools such as those listed below. Note, due to divergence between these tools and the specifications of the COMBINE/OMEX archive and SED-ML formats (see <a [routerLink]="['/help', 'faq']">FAQs</a>), runBioSimulations cannot execute all COMBINE/OMEX archives that can be created with these tools. We are working the community to address these issues.</p>

          execute and the simulation results that you would like to record.
          Currently, all of the simulation tools support a subset of SED-ML
          including one step and timecourse simulations (<code
            >sedml:OneStep</code
          >
          and <code>sedml:UniformTimeCourse</code>), individual simulation tasks
          (<code>sedml:Task</code>), data generators for time and individual
          variables (<code>sedml:DataGenerator</code>), and report outputs
          (<code>sedml:Report</code>). Some of the simulation tools support the
          full SED-ML specification including steady-state simulations
          (<code>sedml:SteadyState</code>), repeated tasks
          (<code>sedml:RepeatedTask</code>), data generators for mathematical
          expressions (<code>sedml:DataGenerator</code>), and plot outputs
          (<code>sedml:Plot2d</code> and <code>sedml:Plot3d</code>). Save these
          files to the directory for the modeling project. More information
          about SED-ML is available from the SED-ML website. Alternatively,

      runBioSimulations uses the BioSimulators collection of simulation tools.
      These tools each support different modeling frameworks, different
      simulation algorithms, and different model formats. The BioSimulators
      website
      <a href="https://biosimulators.org/simulators"
        ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
      ></a>
      outlines the modeling frameworks, simulation algorithms, and model formats
      supported by each tool. After determining the framework and format of your
      model and the simulation algorithm which you would like to execute, use
      this website to identify a simulation tool which is capable of executing
      your modeling project.
