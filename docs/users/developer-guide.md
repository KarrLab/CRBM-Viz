# Developer guide: contributing simulation capabilities

BioSimulations executes projects using the [BioSimulators](https://biosimulators.org) registry of simulation tools. Developers can extend the simulation capabilities of BioSimulations by contributing simulation tools to BioSimulators. This can include tools that support additional modeling frameworks, model formats, and simulation tools. Tutorials, examples, and documentation are available from BioSimulators' website. Please contact the [BioSimulators Team](mailto:info@biosimulators.org) for additional assistance.
