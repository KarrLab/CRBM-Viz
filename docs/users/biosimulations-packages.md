# Documentation for libraries for publishing primary model repositories to BioSimulations

A portion of BioSimulations is derived from several primary model repositories that focus on models of specific biological systems, types of models, model formats, and/or simulation tools. We aim to automatically publish these repositories to BioSimulations each week. This publication will be implemented by a collection of Python packages and GitHub actions. Links to documentation for these packages will be available below.
