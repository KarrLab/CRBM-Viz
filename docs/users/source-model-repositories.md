# Source model repositories

In addition to projects contributed by investigators, BioSimulations also contains projects created from several primary repositories including [BiGG](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/), [BioModels](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), [ModelDB](http://modeldb.science/), the [Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org/), the [Resource Balance Analysis Model Repository](https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models), [RuleHub](https://github.com/RuleWorld/RuleHub), and the [VCell Published Models Database](https://vcell.org/vcell-published-models). Prior to incorporation into BioSimulations, BioSimulations extensively standardizes, quality-controls, and debugs the models and simulations in these resources; generates missing simulations and reports of their results; adds additional visualizations for simulation results; standardizes and fills in missing metadata; and packages these resources into standardized archives.
