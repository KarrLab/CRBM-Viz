## Programmatically working with BioSimulations via the REST API

A comprehensive API is available for submitting and retrieving projects, models, simulations, charts, and visualizations and executing simulations and retrieving their results. Please see the documentation for the REST API  for more information.


## Executing simulations with the standalone simulation web application and REST API

In addition to this full-featured web application, runBioSimulations  provides a simpler web application and REST API for executing simulations. runBioSimulations simply enables users to execute COMBINE archives using a variety of simulation tools and generate time series plots of their results. This application does not require an account.


## Contributing to the BioSimulations platform

We welcome contributions to the BioSimulations platform (e.g., web application, REST API, database, simulation services)! Please see the Guide to Contributing  for information about how to contribute to the platform.
