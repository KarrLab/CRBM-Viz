# Terms of service

## Permitted usage
BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulators promote open science by providing the community a central platform for sharing and executing biomodeling projects and simulation tools. The public simulation projects, simulation tools, and simulation results available through BioSimulations and BioSimulators are available under the open-source licenses chosen by their contributors. These licenses are noted with each resource. BioSimulations imposes no additional restrictions on the use of these community-contributed resources beyond those imposed by their contributors. These licences describe who can use each resource, for which purposes, and what attribution may be required.

To publish a simulation tool, execute a simulation project, or publish a simulation project, users must agree to grant BioSimulators, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulators free of charge, a license to store the tool, project, and/or simulation results.

## Attribution
BioSimulations and BioSimulators request attribution (e.g., in publications, services, or products) for use of their simulation projects, simulation tools, and online services in accordance with good scientific practice. Please use the citations indicated [here](./citations.md).

## Privacy policy
BioSimulations and BioSimulators collect limited personal data. Our [privacy policy](./privacy.md) describes how we collect, store, and use this data and who has access to this data.

## Disclaimers
The simulation tools available through runBioSimulations and BioSimulators and simulation results provided by runBioSimulations and BioSimulations are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the BioSimulations or BioSimulators Teams be liable for any claim, damages or other liability whatsoever, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with these resources or the use or other dealings in these resources.

The BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams do not guarantee the accuracy of the simulation tools available through BioSimulators or runBioSimulations or the simulation results provided by runBioSimulations and BioSimulations, nor the suitability of these resources for any purpose.

The BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams will make reasonable effort to maintain continuity of BioSimulations, runBioSimulations, and BioSimulators. However, the BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams accept no responsibility for the consequences of any temporary or permanent discontinuity in service.

Any feedback provided to the BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams will be treated as non-confidential unless the individual or organization providing the feedback states otherwise.

Any attempt to use BioSimulations or BioSimulators to a level that prevents, or looks likely to prevent, BioSimulations or BioSimulators from servicing other users may result in the use being blocked.

If you post offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content to BioSimulations or BioSimulators, or otherwise engage in disruptive behavior, we may use information from our user behavior logs to stop such behavior. Where we believe that you are, or may be in breach, of any applicable laws, we may use information from our user behavior logs to inform relevant third parties about the content and your behavior.

The BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams do not accept responsibility for personal data voluntarily disclosed through files submitted to BioSimulations or BioSimulators, nor for the consequences of any breach of the confidentiality of simulation studies stored in runBioSimulations or BioSimulations by third parties.

The BioSimulations and BioSimulators Teams are not liable to you or third parties claiming through you, for any loss or damage.
