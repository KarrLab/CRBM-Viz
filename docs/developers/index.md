# Guide to contributing to the BioSimulations and BioSimulators platforms

We enthusiastically welcome contributions to BioSimulations and BioSimulators! This document describes how developers can contribute the BioSimulations and BioSimulators platforms (e.g., web applications, REST APIs, databases, and simulation services). Modelers can contributing models, simulations, and visualizations to BioSimulations via the web application at [https://biosimulations.org](https://biosimulations.org). Information for simulation software tool developers about contributing containerized simulation tools to BioSimulators is available at [https://biosimulators.org/help](https://biosimulators.org/help).

## Coordinating contributions

Before getting started, please contact the lead developers at [info@biosimulations.org](mailto:info@biosimulations.org) to coordinate your planned contributions with other ongoing efforts. Please also use GitHub issues to announce your plans to the community so that other developers can provide input into your plans and coordinate their own work. As the development community grows, we will institute additional infrastructure as needed such as a leadership committee and regular online meetings.

## Repository Conventions

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
The repository uses conventional commits to enable changelog generation and versioning. Commitizen allows developers to easily create compliant commit messages. To use Commitizen, simply run `npm run commit` instead of ` git commit` in your workflow.

## Repository organization

The repository is organized as a monorepo using tooling from [Nx](https://nx.dev/angular/getting-started/why-nx)

### Apps

The apps folder contains code for the high level applications that are a part of Biosimulations. An application is code that is deployed independently, either as a website, API, or backend service.

Each app contains a Readme file that is used to describe its purpose and internal organization.

### Libraries

The libraries folder contains code that can be used by multiple apps. To enforce proper separation of concerns and manage dependency trees, Nx provides constraints on the libraries that can be used by each app. For more information, read the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev/angular/workspace/structure/monorepo-tags), and look at the repository's [linting rules](/.eslintrc). In general, libraries should be organized by the principles recommended [here](https://nx.dev/angular/guides/monorepo-nx-enterprise).

## Coding convention

BioSimulations and BioSimulators follow standard TypeScript style conventions:

- Module names: `lower-dash-case`
- Class names: `UpperCamelCase`
- Function names: `lowerCamelCase`
- Variable names: `lowerCamelCase`

Further information about style conventions can be found in the [lint rules definition](/.eslintrc)

## Linting

We strive to create high-quality code. BioSimulations and BioSimulators use ESLint to identify potential errors. ESLint can be executed by running `nx affected:lint`.

## Testing

We strive to have complete test coverage of BioSimulations and BioSimulators. As such, all contributions to BioSimulations and BioSimulators should be tested. In particular, each module should be accompanied by a specification test in the same directory with the extension `.spec.ts`. The tests can be executed by running `nx affected:test`.

Upon each push and pull request to GitHub, GitHub will trigger actions to execute all of the tests.

## Submitting changes

Please use GitHub pull requests to submit changes. Each request should include a brief description of the new and/or modified features. Upon each pull request, GitHub will trigger actions to execute all of the tests. Pull requests will be approved once all tests are passing and the pull request is reviewed by one of the lead developers.

## Releasing and deploying new versions

Contact [info@biosimulations.org](mailto:info@biosimulations.org) to request release and deployment of new changes.

### Nx

This project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev). The below information should be sufficient for most development in the repository.

#### Quick Start & Documentation

[Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/angular)

[10-minute video showing all Nx features](https://nx.dev/angular/getting-started/what-is-nx)

[Interactive Tutorial](https://nx.dev/angular/tutorial/01-create-application)

##### Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

##### Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@biosimulations/mylib`.

##### Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##### Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

##### Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

##### Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

##### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

##### Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
