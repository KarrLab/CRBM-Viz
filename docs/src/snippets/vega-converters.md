To help investigators use Vega to visualize simulation results, BioSimulators-utils provide a command-line program and Python API for converting several types of structural diagrams of models into Vega data visualizations of simulation results. This includes activity network diagrams created with [GINsim](http://ginsim.org/), reaction flux maps created with [Escher](https://escher.github.io/), and [SBGN](https://sbgn.github.io/) process description maps.
